                These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by
                us on the Services or in respect to the Services constitute the
                entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these
                Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
                provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent
                permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and
                obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible
                or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused
                by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or
                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be
                unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the
                provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does
                not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment
                or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of
                these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that these
                Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all <bdt></bdt>defences
