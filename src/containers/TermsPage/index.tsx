                or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or

                part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the

                drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have based on the electronic form of these
                Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
